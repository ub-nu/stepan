Erdogan's lead shrinks with more than 90% of votes tallied in unofficial count

Recep Tayyip Erdogan maintains a slight lead in his race for a historic third term as Turkey's president. His lead against opponent Kemal Kilicdaroglu has, however, dwindled as preliminary results continue to come in from state-run news agency Anadolu.

Here are the latest numbers from Anadolu:

    Votes counted: 91.55%
    Erdogan: 52.61%
    Kilicdaroglu: 47.39%
    Participation rate: 85.41%

Figures published by Anadolu are unofficial. The official result of the election will be published by Turkey's Supreme Election Council.
